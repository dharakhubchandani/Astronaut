On the Astronaut data set, the notebook does exploratory data analysis. The data set was obtained from the kaggle website. 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nasa/astronaut-yearbook

The notebook made use of several packages.
The following packages are used:

### numpy & pandas
### matplotlib.pyplot & seaborn
The first two packages deal with data manipulating and data analysis, while the other two deal with data visualization.

Three critical steps to follow in this EDA are :

####  1- Understand the data

####  2- Clean the data

####  3- Discover a relationship between variables.

In this project I have successfully:

####  * Loaded the dataset and had a look at it.
####  * Explored the various categories in dataset.
####  * Done some serious EDA of feature variables, categorical and numeric.
